      <h2>Mod 2 Pre-work</h2>
        <h3>My Module 1 Experience</h3>
        <p>It took me two tries to get past module one.  The first time through
          I was struggling to keep my mouth above water and it really showed
          through my community involvement.  My second time through module one
          I was determined to improve my Ruby abilities and also play a much
          larger role in the Turing community.  Before the module started I
          was active on Slack offering my cohort help, and I continued this in
          person when the module started.  At first, it was just me pairing with
          classmates on homework, drills, and projects.  However, as the weeks
          went on I found that I was feeling like more of friends with many of the
          people I had been assisting, I feel like many of them feel the same way
          about me.
        </p>
          <h3>My favorite technical concept</h3>
          <p>Going through module one the first time, I was much too focused on
            functionality and less focused on ruby style and testing.  This really
            hurt me when it came to the final project which was much larger than
            any project I had experience with.  My second time through module one
            I was determined to focus on Test Driven Development (TDD). TDD is a best
            practice which ensures the applications you are writing are broken down
            into small, logical, and testable incremental steps.  TDD first
            requires you to write a test that fails before you write code for your
            application.  After writing a failing test, you write as litte and
            simple code for your application that is necessary to get the test
            passing, then you write a new test.  TDD seems unintuitive and
            constrictive when first starting using this style of development,
            however with practice you will soon see benefits in your code.

      <h2>Why use Bcrypt?</h3>
        <h3>Introduction to Bcrypt</h5>
          <p>
            Bcrypt is used as the default password storage hashing algorithm in
            the OpenBSD Project, which is reguaded as the most secure way to
            store passwords.  As developers it is our responsibility to protect
            our users from breaches to our databases.
          </p>
        <h3>Hashing Algorithms</h3>
          <p>
            Hashing is a transformation of a string into a string of fixed length
            that represents the original string.  Hashing is always a one way
            operation, there is no way to go back, if a hash can be reverse
            engineered it is not sufficient to use for encryption.  A good hash
            function will produce different outputs from the same inputs, this
            this is called collision, the lower the risk of collision the better
            .
          </p>
        <h3>Rainbow Tables</h5>
          <p>
            Rainbow tables are precomputed tables for reverse engineering hashes
            used for encryption, typically password hashes.  
          </p>
        <h3>Salting</h5>
          <p>Bcrypt has salts built into prevent rainbow table attacks!</p>

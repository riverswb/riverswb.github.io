      <h2>Mod 2 Pre-work</h2>
        <h3>My Module 1 Experience</h3>
        <p>It took me two tries to get past module one.  The first time through
          I was struggling to keep my mouth above water and it really showed
          through my community involvement.  My second time through module one
          I was determined to improve my Ruby abilities and also play a much
          larger role in the Turing community.  Before the module started I
          was active on Slack offering my cohort help, and I continued this in
          person when the module started.  At first, it was just me pairing with
          classmates on homework, drills, and projects.  However, as the weeks
          went on I found that I was feeling like more of friends with many of the
          people I had been assisting, I feel like many of them feel the same way
          about me.
        </p>
          <h3>My favorite technical concept</h3>
          <p>Going through module one the first time, I was much too focused on
            functionality and less focused on ruby style and testing.  This really
            hurt me when it came to the final project which was much larger than
            any project I had experience with.  My second time through module one
            I was determined to focus on Test Driven Development (TDD). TDD is a best
            practice which ensures the applications you are writing are broken down
            into small, logical, and testable incremental steps.  TDD first
            requires you to write a test that fails before you write code for your
            application.  After writing a failing test, you write as litte and
            simple code for your application that is necessary to get the test
            passing, then you write a new test.  TDD seems unintuitive and
            constrictive when first starting using this style of development,
            however with practice you will soon see benefits in your code.

      <h2>Why use Bcrypt?</h3>
        <h3>Introduction to Bcrypt</h3>
          <p>
            Bcrypt is used as the default password storage hashing algorithm in
            the OpenBSD Project, which is reguaded as the most secure way to
            store passwords.  As developers it is our responsibility to protect
            our users from breaches to our databases.
          </p>
        <h3>Hashing Algorithms</h3>
          <p>
            Hashing is a transformation of a string into a string of fixed length
            that represents the original string.  Hashing is always a one way
            operation, there is no way to go back, if a hash can be reverse
            engineered it is not sufficient to use for encryption.  A good hash
            function will produce different outputs from the same inputs. If the
            hash output for the same inputs is equal, this is called collision
            , the lower the risk of collision the better.
          </p>
        <h3>Rainbow Tables</h3>
          <p>
            When passwords were stored as plaintext in databases, dictionary
            attacks were a common method to gain access to an account, using a
            predefined list of guesses.  As we evolved our methods of storing
            passwords, from plaintext to encrypted hashes, methods used
            to gain access evolved as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rainbow tables are precomputed tables for reverse engineering hashes
            used for encryption, typically password hashes. Since rainbow tables
            are precomputed, they are easily overcome by adding a salt to the
            passwords.
          </p>
        <h3>Salting</h3>
          <p>
            In cryptology, salt is random data that is used to make passwords
            more secure.  Salt is automatically added to the password, when it
            is  being stored in the database.  Since the salt is added
            automatically it can make dictionary  and rainbow table exploits
            prohibitively long, without impacting the user experience.
            <strong>Bcrypt has salts built into prevent rainbow table attacks!
            </strong>
          </p>
        <h3>Using Bcrypt</h3>
        <p>Using Bcrypt is simple, the following list assumes you already have
          all necessary functionality, but you are storing passwords in plain
          text.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Add a "password_digest" column, which is a
            string, to the user table</li>
            <li>Remove the "password" column from the user table.</li>
            <li>In you're Gemfile uncomment the bcrypt gem: "gem 'bcrypt', '~>
              3.1.7'"</li>
            <li>In the user model file add "has_secure_password", this gives
              the user model bcrypt authentication methods.</li>
            <li>Run "bundle install" and restart the rails server.</li>
            <li>In you're forms, continue to use "password" or :password to create
              users and login users.</li>
        </ol>

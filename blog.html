      <h3>My Module 1 Experience</h3>
      <p>It took me two tries to get past module one.  The first time through
        I was struggling to keep my mouth above water and it really showed
        through my community involvement.  My second time through module one
        I was determined to improve my Ruby abilities and also play a much
        larger role in the Turing community.  Before the module started I
        was active on Slack offering my cohort help, and I continued this in
        person when the module started.  At first, it was just me pairing with
        classmates on homework, drills, and projects.  However, as the weeks
        went on I found that I was feeling like more of friends with many of the
        people I had been assisting, I feel like many of them feel the same way
        about me.</p>
        <h3>My favorite technical concept</h3>
        <p>Going through module one the first time, I was much too focused on
          functionality and less focused on ruby style and testing.  This really
          hurt me when it came to the final project which was much larger than
          any project I had experience with.  My second time through module one
          I was determined to focus on Test Driven Development (TDD). TDD is a best
          practice which ensures the applications you are writing are broken down
          into small, logical, and testable incremental steps.  TDD first
          requires you to write a test that fails before you write code for your
          application.  After writing a failing test, you write as litte and
          simple code for your application that is necessary to get the test
          passing, then you write a new test.  TDD seems unintuitive and
          constrictive when first starting using this style of development,
          however with practice you will soon see benefits in your code.</p>
